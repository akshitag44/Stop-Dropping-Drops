Successfully put the background video on a website, starting to get familiar to HTML and CSS again.

Created a nav bar, kind of offseted though. I did however create a logo and and favicon for the website. I need to fix the nav bar tomorrow as how I am envisioning it.

March 26, 2020:
Finished the Nav bar, got the logo to be in the middle of website and to rotate. Added an outline to the text in the nav bar for easier readiabilitty. One problem I came across, there was a huge white space below the bacground video, and it was scrollable.
